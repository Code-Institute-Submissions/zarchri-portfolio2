        <ol>Part of the reason Disney's movies were so successful was that the animators were amazing
            dedicated to getting things right. To make the cuddly characters in his films as realistic as
            possible, he often took in live animals in the studio. During the production for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was taken
            live rabbits, skunks and horses in for the animators to study. Likewise, two fawns roamed
            around during the production of Bambi</ol>
